Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
===================

#### GOAL: Create an R script that does the following. 
  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
    
#### Project Artifacts
  * **./YYYYMMDD_data.zip**  - the downloaded data file from the data source 
  * **./data**             - the unzipped downloaded data with all the data
  * **./README.md**          - this document. The project documentation.
  * **./Codebook.md**        - the project recipe, codebook, and process to reproduce the results
  * **./run_analysis.R**     - the script that takes the data as input and generates the expected result.
  * **./tidy_data.txt        - The tidy dataset exported as comma delimited file.
  
#### How use this project
  * Read this document(**README.md**) thoroughly
  * Execute **./run_analysis.R**
  * Read the *Codebook.md* to understand **run_analysis.R** and the resulting tidy dataset in **./tidy_data.txt**
